# Speech-Recognition-App
A Python speech recognition app that uses a fine-tuned version of the Whisper model. This model has been trained on a custom dataset of our AI professor's voice.
To view the dataset, arrangements can be made by contacting me via the details on my CV. The dataset is kept confidential to protect our professor's privacy.
